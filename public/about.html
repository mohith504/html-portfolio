  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    Hi! I’m <strong>Mohith Pavan</strong>, a curious builder and lifelong learner based in
    <em>Bengaluru, India</em>. I’m currently a student at the <strong>Bangalore Institute of Technology</strong>,
    where I enjoy turning ideas into real, usable things—whether that’s a small web app,
    a data experiment, or a design that simply feels right.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love working on projects that blend <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>creativity</strong>, and
    <strong>problem-solving</strong>. Recently, I’ve been exploring cleaner UI patterns, automation for
    everyday tasks, and ways to learn faster by building in public. I’m big on clear communication,
    writing things down, and keeping my work simple, reliable, and a little bit playful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of screens, you’ll catch me meeting new people at local events, playing sports,
    or hunting for great coffee. I value teams that are kind, feedback-friendly, and ambitious—
    the sort of places where ideas move quickly and everyone learns together.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m always up for collaborating on interesting problems. If something here resonates,
    feel free to reach out—let’s build something we’re proud of.
